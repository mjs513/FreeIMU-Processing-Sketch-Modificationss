FreeIMU-Processing-Sketch-Modificationss
========================================

Modified the original FreeIMU Cube Sketch to include data display of accel, gyro, magnetometer calibrated values.
The display includes temp and pressure if a MS5611 sensor is available. You will need the FreeIMU_serial.ino Arudino
sketch to use this file otherwise you will need to modify data display.
